## Introduction

TIBCOÂ® Developer Hub provides three example templates, one example group and one example system, which will be added to the software catalog as the default catalog configuration (If catalog configuration is not overwritten). These templates will kickstart a sample project for you which you can develop further.

## Included Templates

### BWCE Bookstore Template

The BWCE bookstore exposes a REST service, and serves as the de facto standard example for BWCE implementations. It either connects to a file or a database where the information about books(like title and ISBN number) is stored. Through the API books can be; requested, added, removed and updated in the bookstore.

### Documentation Template

This template helps you create [TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/), which saves you the time to setup TechDocs for your project from scratch. It takes care of the steps required for generating a TechDoc, which you can later use to write documentation for your software components.

### Flogo Template

The Flogo template example exposes and API that calls an API on the backend, the template takes the endpoint of this API as input.

## Running the templates

To run the templates, you can navigate to "Create" from the left navigation, select a template that you wish to run. Carefully fill out the steps and select a location where you wish the generated code to get saved [check backstage documentation for the list of included providers](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/), and lastly, select a unique name for your repository, and hit "create". The template will run you through a series of steps, and lastly, upon successful completion of all the steps, you should see a link to the source where your repository is created.
